    # TODO: This class should which Implements the following functionality:
    # - opencv HOGDescriptor combined with a sliding window
    # - perform detection at multiple scales, i.e. you need to scale the extracted patches when performing the detection
    # - non maximum suppression: eliminate detections using non-maximum-suppression based on the overlap area

class CustomHogDetector:

    # Some constants that you will be using in your implementation
    detection_width	= 64 # the crop width dimension
    detection_height = 128 # the crop height dimension
    window_stride = 32 # the stride size 
    scaleFactors = [1.2] # scale each patch down by this factor, feel free to try other values
    # You may play with different values for these two theshold values below as well 
    hit_threshold = 0 # detections above this threshold are counted as positive. 
    overlap_threshold = 0.3 # if the overlap between two detections is above this threshold, eliminate the one with the lower confidence score.
