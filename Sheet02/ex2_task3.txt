Splitting function uses a single value out of 16X16X3 patch at every node for making a decision. 
This single value does not give a good picture of what is present in the patch. It could be some noise as well.
Appropriate Splitting function can improve the results.

Also Test Set has some bright images, which would make it difficult to choose a proper threshold. Mean normalisation can assist in this issue.
